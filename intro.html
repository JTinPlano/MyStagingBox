	Donations

  </h3>
  <div>
	<div class="introtext">This site will be financed totally by your donations.  As long as I can pay the bills from donations, I won't ever charge a fee to list events or for advertising.  I only ask that you make a donation at least once a year, and base the amount (Pewter, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Multi-Platinum) on how much you like the site and how easy you find it to use and navigate.<br>I plan to hire a professional web development firm to take over the development, provided there are sufficient donations with which to pay for their services.  The advantage of doing that will minimize the timeframe needed to improve and expand the features and capabilities of the site.  Please bear that in mind when making your donation.

  </h3>

	<div class="introtext">
	Over the next few months, I will be making improvements and adding new functionality, and there will be a blog and photo gallery as soon as I figure out how to tie your registration to both of those so you don't have to register three times.  I've got quite a few things I want to do to the site over the next few months.  If possible, I'll execute the plan I described under "Donations".

	About Me
    </a>
  </h3>
  <div>
	<div class="introtext">MyStagingBox.com has been, and will continue to be, a labor of love.  I am a child of the 60's and remember muscle cars in dealer showrooms, and having friends who got them as graduation gifts.  My first almost-muscle car was a 1968 LeMans, 350, 4-bbl, 4-speed with AC, PS, and PB.  That's still my favorite car to this day, although I've had two restoration businesses that ultimately failed and took me down the tubes financially.  Fast forward to the late 1980's.<br><br>I moved to Dallas to go to a computer maintenance and repair school and found that I had a knack for troubleshooting and fixing computers.  Then I took a couple of C and C++ programming classes and found that I REALLY liked programming.  Fast forward to the mid-1990's.<br><br>I was introduced to the Internet in 1996 and logged in to AOL in November of that year.  As a result, I taught myself how to build web pages, then added PERL scripting, went to work for a dot com, learned Java and database SQL.<br><br>I finally settled for PHP and MySQL as my web development tools of choice and have been playing around with that type of Internet technology.  In 2004, I met a couple who ran car shows and found I liked them.  I also learned that it was a pain finding a web site with a list of car shows and that it was an even bigger pain to get a car show scheduled on any of the sites of which I knew.  More recently, I've learned the latest "Web 2.0" technologies upon which Facebook, Twitter, and many other web sites are built.  Those technologies are the basis for this, my first, Web 2.0 site.<br><br>I just wanted to let everyone know why I built this site:  My love of the classic and muscle cars, and web site development.  This has been a 3-year labor of love, and all of your donations will be greatly appreciated.
